Control Sony CLED display controller model ZRCT-300 using ADCP protocol, typically on TCP port 53595.
There are several different types of Sony CLEDs, each with different supported controllers. This module supports only one of those controllers ZRCT-300; it is not evaluated for ZRCT-100 or ZRCT-200.

Multiple CLED controllers may be controlled together by adding each IP address.
